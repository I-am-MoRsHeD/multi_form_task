## ðŸ§  Handling Complex Logic

1. As this is my first multi step form task,i have tried my best to solve via mine but for time saving,i have used Chatgpt and ask him how it works,takes proper explanation and everything that i need to understand the flow.
2. I almost crossed every step in very much trouble and very much hard to think. I thought about the flow,how i can put this,if i put like this,how can i catch it in another file if i need etc.
3. After all, i have completed this task but yeah everyone is not perfect. I have tried my best to complete each and every validation,but some of are still remains.
4. Please consider this as much as you can.

## ðŸ“Œ Assumptions

First of all,i have read all the requirements and think about which one is required and which is optional.Then i enquire which fields are depended on which fields and thinking how can i maintain this thing so that i can catch easily them and code won't be messy. Then thinking about some logics and folder structure. I have written in my notebook all the needed and rest deeds which i have to complete and through this,i have completed this within deadline.
